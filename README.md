# ZkSync Transaction Fee Subsidization with Paymasters and Account Abstraction

This repository showcases a use case of leveraging Paymasters and Account Abstraction in the ZkSync network to enable users to perform transactions on Layer 2 for free. By subsidizing transaction fees through Paymasters and utilizing Account Abstraction, users can enjoy seamless and cost-effective transactions on the ZkSync network.

## Overview

In today's Ethereum ecosystem, high transaction fees have become a significant barrier to mass adoption. However, ZkSync, as a Layer 2 solution, aims to tackle this challenge by offering lower transaction fees and introducing powerful features such as Account Abstraction and Paymasters. While some users may express concerns about paying for transactions, it's important to recognize that many services we use daily, like YouTube and Spotify, require payment for premium plans or rely on advertising and user data. In a similar vein, Paymasters can be seen as a service, like Google Ads, that facilitates the monetization of transactions. Paymasters have the potential to assist businesses in achieving wider adoption and visibility by covering gas fees, ultimately fostering growth and supporting the Ethereum ecosystem's sustainability.
